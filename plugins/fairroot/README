Plugin for adding pluto to FAIRROOT

_________________________________________________________________________________

1. Adding an updated Pluto version to fairsoft
_________________________________________________________________________________

1.1 ---------------------

Requirements: 
* An installation of fairsoft
* The environment variable SIMPATH must be defined

Unpack Pluto somewhere but *not* in fairsoft
Go to the Pluto directory and type:
   "make fairroot"
This will create a tar-ball in your fairsoft directory with all
what is needed later

1.2 ---------------------

Changes to the fairsoft-scripts:

In "scripts/install_pluto.sh" one has to exchange
the line:

   patch -p0 < ../pluto_v412.patch | tee -a $logfile

by the lines:

   case $PLUTOVERSION in
     *412*)  echo Compiling Old Pluto Version
	     patch -p0 < ../pluto_v412.patch | tee -a $logfile
	     ;;
     *5*)  echo Compiling v5.x Pluto Version;; 
     *CVS*)  echo Compiling CVS Pluto Version;; 
    esac

1.3 ---------------------

In principle one can keep various Pluto versions. To enable
and compile one out of them, change in "scripts/package_versions.sh"
    export PLUTOVERSION=Pluto.v412
to:
    export PLUTOVERSION=Pluto.5.32

(no "v", and with a dot between major and minor number!)

2. Running Pluto as an inline event generator
