This folder contains several files that will be explained briefly:


1.1 Macros/
-----------------

           - 6 macros that generate the phase space values of the break-
             up reaction on the targets 3He, 4He, 7Li, 12C, 40Ca and 93Nb:

                - He3_breakup_macro.C
                - He4_breakup_macro.C
                - Li7_breakup_macro.C
                - C12_breakup_macro.C
                - Ca40_breakup_macro.C
                - Nb93_breakup_macro.C                     

             These breakup reactions are all done with the neutron as participant,
             except for the one on 3He, in this case a proton is the participant. 
             This macro (He3_breakup_macro.C) can be used as an example how to 
             adjust the others to the case of the proton as participant.

           - A method that checks the new implemented quasi-free reaction used in
             the class. The check is based on the kinematics of a three-body decay in
             which the two mesons (eta and pi0) are considered to be one particle, i.e.:

             g+A -> (eta + pi0) + N + (A-1)

             This method calculates the four-momentum of the recoil participant nucleon (N)
             from which the four-momentum of the spectator nucleus fragment (A-1) can be 
             determined that yields the reconstruction of the fermi-momentum.

                - KineticRecoilEnergy.C

           - A macro that draws all implemented fermi-momentum distributions into 
             one single histogram.

                - DrawAllFermiDistributions.C
           
           - A rootlogon file that contains the settings to achieve the .eps and .ps
             image AllFermiDistributions.eps.

                - rootlogon.C


1.2 AnalyzeMacros/
-----------------

           - 6 macros that analyze the generated phase space values obtained from
             the *_breakup_macros.C explained above. It illustrates the polar and
             azimuthal angle distributions of the eta, pi0 and participant recoil
             nucleon as well as the fermi-momentum of the spectator, its reconstruction
             and the original distribution. Note that one has to adjust the beam energy.

                - analyze_g3He.C
                - analyze_g4He.C
                - analyze_g7Li.C
                - analyze_g12C.C
                - analyze_g40Ca.C
                - analyze_g93Nb.C


1.3 Pictures/
-----------------

           - The output of the macro DrawAllFermiDistributions.C explained in 1.1 as an
             .eps and .ps file that show all implemented fermi distributions in one single 
             histogram.

                - AllFermiDistributions.eps
                - AllFermiDistributions.ps

1.4 src-files
-----------------

           - This folder includes the two classes and header files that generate the 
             reactions g+A with fermi motion of the nucleons in the nuclei.

                - The fermi distributions of the targets 3He, 4He, 7Li, 12C and 40Ca
                  are implemented as functions.
